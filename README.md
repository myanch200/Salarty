    <h3>About the project</h3>
    <p>The project was part of a course 
    work during my second year at university.
    It consist of 4 html pages and serves as a tool to calculate your salary or a way to learn more information about a job position.
    The project is build using only html ,css and a little bit of JavaScript.
    The whole purpose of the project was to gain some experience in working with 3<sup>rd</sup> part API's and manipulating the DOM structure. During the development of the project I have tried to make use of good practices such as using Semantic HTML and undestandable naming convention.

<h3>Job Information Page</h3>
<p>For me personally this was the most interesting part of the project.
    I have really learned a lot from this project and it made me realise why front-end developers need frameworks.
    Manipulation the DOM with vanilla javascript is definetly not the best option out there. On the other hand it really help me learn more about event handlers , promises and DOM manipulation.
